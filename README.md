# Firebase Collection

## Description

Firebase Collection is a simple library that wraps the Firebase API in reactive LocalCollections. This allows developers to use the familiar Minimongo API with a Firebase backend, on the server as well as the client.

**This package is still in early development, use with caution in production environments!**


## Data structure

In order to make the transition between MongoDB and Firebase as easy as possible, I decided to only support a particular subset of Firebase: Lists of objects. This means that a FirebaseCollection always has to be a reference to a [list of data](https://www.firebase.com/docs/managing-lists.html). FirebaseCollection will transparently add an `_id` attribute to every child, containing the index of the child. This allows for matching behaviour with MongoDB collections.

Your Firebase list therefore corresponds to a MongoDB collection, whereas every child of the Firebase list corresponds to a MongoDB document. Here's an example of a list of users:

## Example

```javascript
// You can create a new Firebase Collection very similar to the original Firebase API:
Users = new FirebaseCollection(YOUR_FIREBASE_REFERENCE_URL);

// FirebaseCollections support most of the regular LocalCollection API:
var allFoobars = Users.find({ name: 'Foo Bar' }).fetch();
var oneFoobar = Users.findOne({ name: 'Foo Bar' });
var newFoobarId = Users.insert({ name: 'Foo Bar' });
var foobarChanged = Users.update({ name: 'Foo Bar' }, { name: 'Mr. Foo Bar' }, { multi: true });

// These methods however are not supported:
// - Users.allow(...)
// - Users.deny(...)
// - Users.upsert(...)
// - Users.update(selector, modifier, { upsert: true })

// FirebaseCollections are reactive:
Deps.autorun(function () {
  // This will re-run everytime the Users-collection changes:
  console.log('User count: ' + Users.find({}).count());
});
```

## About livedata

This package does not depend on livedata or any related packages, thus it can be used without persistent connections to the server. Be aware, though, that the default *webapp* package does depend on livedata, so an alternative has to be used in order to completely avoid any DDP-connection.
